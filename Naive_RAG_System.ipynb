The Mash: GIGO (Garbage In, Garbage Out) Beyond just the basic purpose of a dis- tillation engine, the individual pieces of each machine also have direct relationships. While each moonshiner has his own personal recipes, the basic inputs to a still are grains/sugars, yeast and water, which are combined into a  mash . Recipes vary during the year based on the price/availability of raw ingredients. The result is a balance between the strength of the mash (how much alcohol can be concentrated into the final mixture) and the potableness (suitability for drinking). A mash that is too  hot  (not able to be consumed, due to the burning feeling when consuming) is as undesirable as a mash that is too  cold  (no alcohol but is more potable). Balancing these competing properties is the art in the process that has been handed down through generations of shiners. Likewise, within any Big Data marketing system, a multitude of different inputs are available to gain marketing insights and knowledge. Referral data, search engine data, onsite tracking, social data, CRM, demographics and a host of other data sources all contribute to the digital mar- keter s mash. Some of these sources are\n",

There is another dangerous phenomenon that occurs in Big Data Stills as well as moonshine stills. During the fermentation process, a certain portion of the mash will be converted into methanol (C3OH). Methanol is a highly dangerous substance that has been known to cause blindness and even death. As a still heats up the mash releases this methanol (methanol boils at a lower temperature that alcohol), shiners call this the foreshot and discard this dangerous byproduct. This is very similar to Big Data Stills where the initial set of analysis (foreshot) from the data can be very disorienting and can blind marketers to the insights behind the data. Likewise, many times marketers overfit and/or over analyze the data mash which can lead to marketing paralysis or dangerous results. From Steam to Hooch: The Rest of the Journey Once the alcohol s heavy steam has left the mash pot, it flows through a series of pipes and tubes. The first stop is the thump keg, which filters the impurities from the steam, which if allowed to continue through the process, will clog up the increasing smaller diameter piping that makes up the rest of the still. Filtering the haze of analysis to ensure that it is accurate, reliable and true is also necessary in a Big Data Still. Out-\n",
